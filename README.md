# SC-Genomics
This is a repo that contains relevant info regarding single-cell DNA (exome and whole genome) sequencing computational analysis and interpretation, including protocols, pipelines, peak calling algorithms, benchmarking articles, and applications of these techniques.

## Early Work

### Tumour evolution inferred by single-cell sequencing
Nicholas Navin, et al. Tumour evolution inferred by single-cell sequencing. _Nature_ (2011).

This was the first demonstration of single-cell DNA sequencing across the whole genome, and was used to reconstruct and model the evolutionary history of the tumor. The authors were able to identify distinct subpopulations that likely gave rise to clonal expansions with divergent structural variations containing potent oncogenes. 

### Genome-wide copy number analysis of single cells
Timour Baslan, et al. Genome-wide copy number analysis of single cells. _Nature Protocols_ (2012).

This is an accompanying detailed protocol based on the previous paper.
